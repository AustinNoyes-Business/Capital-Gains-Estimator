# Capital-Gains-Estimator

This software is intended to provide three core functions: (1) user-generated database of mutual funds and their capital gains distribution amounts, (2) user-generated portfolio database of mutual funds and (3) the ability to run a report with mutual fund capital gains information against a new or existing portfolio (see function #2) to estimate the portfolio's capital gain tax exposure at year-end.
